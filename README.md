# Feed-Forward Neural Network in C

A graphical, modular, feed-forward neural network created around the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

This project implements a fully configurable neural network from scratch in C, supporting any number of layers and neurons per layer. It is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, with no external machine learning libraries.

An SDL2-based interface is included to:
- Draw digits in a 28×28 grid
- View live predictions from the trained model
- Visualize the network’s learned weight matrices

## Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilfriedman/Graphical_Feed_Forward_Neural_Network.git
   cd Graphical_Feed_Forward_Neural_Network
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   network.exe
